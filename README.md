# Welcome to the Airbyte Interop Catalog

The Airbyte Interop Catalog is an [open source](./LICENSE.md), AI-powered catalog of resources which help users compare and convert data across different database schemas. The Interop Catalog contains tools, guides, and reusable dbt packages. See the [Catalog](./catalog/README.md) for a list of supported sources.

## Locating Catalog Resources

See the [catalog](./catalog) directory for reusable dbt packages and data mapping guides. Browse this catalog to find and use transformation packages for various data sources.

## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Changes

The resources in this catalog exist to aid in migrations and interop. However, please be aware that AI-generated results may contain errors.

To request new source mappings, ask questions, or report bugs, please use our [Github Issues Tracker](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-interop-catalog/issues). 

## Advanced Usage

Airbyte Morph is an [open source](./LICENSE.md) AI-powered mapping tool behind the Airbyte Interop Catalog. As we improve the Morph tool over time, expect the quality of migration guides and dbt packages to similarly improve over time. See the [Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md) for detailed instructions on how to use Airbyte Morph, the AI tool for mapping any source schema against any target schema.
