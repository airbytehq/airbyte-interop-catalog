              updating an active workflow scheme. An active workflow scheme is a workflow
              scheme that is used by at least one project. The following examples
              show how this property works:\n\n *  Update an active workflow scheme
              with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to `true`: If a draft workflow scheme
              exists, it is updated. Otherwise, a draft workflow scheme is created.\n
              *  Update an active workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to
              `false`: An error is returned, as active workflow schemes cannot be
              updated.\n *  Update an inactive workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded`
              set to `true`: The workflow scheme is updated, as inactive workflow
              schemes do not require drafts to update.\n\nDefaults to `false`."
