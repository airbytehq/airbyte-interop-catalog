    explanation: Mapping confidence is moderately high with some matching issues due
      to possibly differing meanings, though the fields 'id' and 'name' are well aligned
      with respective schema requirements. 70% confidence is based on the possibility
      that 'id' and 'name' correctly correspond to target schema fields, but there
      remains some uncertainty.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: workflow_status_categories.id
        score: 0.7
        explanation: The 'id' from 'workflow_status_categories.id' matches standard
          ID conventions in the target schema, though exact table match cannot be
          fully confirmed.
      - name: name
        expression: workflow_status_categories.name
        score: 0.7
        explanation: The 'name' mapping from 'workflow_status_categories.name' aligns
          well by naming convention, suggesting a proper descriptor role in the target
          schema.
