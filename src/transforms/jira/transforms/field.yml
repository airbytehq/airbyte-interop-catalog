  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: issue_fields
    target_table_name: field
    table_match_score: 0.65
    completion_score: 0.75
    explanation: The table match score reflects a moderate level of confidence that
      the source and target tables are describing the same subject matter, with most
      fields properly mapped but some missing critical mappings. The completion score
      indicates a reasonable but not full coverage of field mappings between source
      and target schemas.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: issue_fields.id
        score: 0.95
        explanation: The field 'id' maps directly and specifically to an identical
          field in the target schema, ensuring a high confidence score.
      - name: is_array
        expression: MISSING
        score: 0.0
        explanation: No good match found.
      - name: is_custom
        expression: issue_fields.custom
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Although 'is_custom' maps to 'issue_fields.custom', the semantic
          alignment is not perfect, reflecting a good but cautious confidence score.
      - name: name
        expression: issue_fields.name
        score: 0.85
        explanation: The field 'name' directly correlates with 'issue_fields.name',
          aligning well semantically and structurally.
