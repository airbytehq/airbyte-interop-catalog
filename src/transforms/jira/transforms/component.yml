    explanation: The table mapping between project_components and a similar schema
      is highly aligned with a small disparity in field completeness.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: project_components.id
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct match found for 'id' as 'project_components.id'.
      - name: description
        expression: project_components.description
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Direct match found for 'description' as 'project_components.description',
          aligning perfectly with the schema requirement.
      - name: name
        expression: project_components.name
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Direct mapping located for 'name' as 'project_components.name',
          fitting well within schema requirements.
      - name: project_id
        expression: project_components.projectId
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Mapped 'project_id' to 'project_components.projectId', likely
          same due to context but presence of 'project' in both field names indicates
          a close but not perfect match.
