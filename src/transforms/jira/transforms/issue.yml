    explanation: The target schema closely reflects the source schema with minor differences
      in field serialization and naming conventions. Most fields are mapped accurately,
      though some are marked as 'MISSING' due to lack of exact correspondence. The
      understanding of the project context and additional mapping instructions has
      been pivotal in generating precise mappings and providing reasonable confidence
      levels.
