  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: LeadHistory
    target_table_name: lead
    table_match_score: 0.5
    completion_score: 0.4
    explanation: Given the high number of fields with an expression set to 'MISSING',
      indicating a lack of a direct or satisfactory match, the overall mapping confidence
      is moderate. The table match suggests some relation, reflective of a typical
      Airbyte to Fivetran syncing scenario; however, several critical data points
      for effective transformation could not be adequately mapped.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id

        score: 0.8
        explanation: Direct mapping available from 'LeadHistory.Id'

      - name: _fivetran_active
        expression: LeadHistory.IsDeleted

        explanation: Mapping 'LeadHistory.IsDeleted' to '_fivetran_active' reasonably
          captures the active status based on deletion flag.
