          with triggers, workflows, and data validation rules that are associated
          with the record. The label is Name ID. Beginning in API version 37.0, if
          the contact or lead ID in the WhoId field is not in the TaskWhoIds list,
          no error occurs and the ID is added to the TaskWhoIds as the primary WhoId.
          If WhoId is set to null, an arbitrary ID from the existing TaskWhoIds list
          is promoted to the primary position.
