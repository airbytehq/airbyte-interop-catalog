  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: teams
    target_table_name: team
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.83
    explanation: The table match score is high due to the consistency of the source
      and target data, indicating a strong correlation in the intended subject matter.
      The completion score is relatively high but not perfect due to one missing mapping
      ('parent_id'). This affects the overall integrity slightly but the majority
      of fields are well accounted for with accurate mappings.
