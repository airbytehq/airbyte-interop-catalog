  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: teams
    target_table_name: team
    table_match_score: 0.9
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: The table mapping has high confidence as both source and target tables
      refer to team data and correspond well in terms of context. However, complete
      mapping coverage is not achieved as some source implementations do not serialize
      all fields matched to the target, leading to a slightly lower completion score.
