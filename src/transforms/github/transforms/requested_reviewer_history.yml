    table_match_score: 0.85

    explanation: The table match is highly confident due to the similarity of the
      source and target schemas originating from similar source APIs, indicating they
      likely describe the same subject matter. However, the completion score is reduced
      due to the missing mappings for several fields which could not find a good match.
