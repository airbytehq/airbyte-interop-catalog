  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: users
    target_table_name: user
    table_match_score: 0.75
    completion_score: 0.5
    explanation: The table match score is relatively high due to the consistent source
      mapping for user-related fields, indicating that the source and target tables
      align well in subject matter. However, the completion score is moderate because
      some key fields like 'name' and 'company' are missing, lowering the overall
      integrity of the data mapping.
