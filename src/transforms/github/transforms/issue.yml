  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: issues
    target_table_name: issue
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.9
    explanation: High confidence in table matching due to alignment of key structural
      elements and data types across fields. The majority of fields have strong and
      meaningful mappings, only a few fields have weaker correlations which affect
      the completion score slightly.
