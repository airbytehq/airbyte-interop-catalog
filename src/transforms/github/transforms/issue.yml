    table_match_score: 0.75

    explanation: The mapping of source schema to target schema seems to be fairly
      accurate and appropriate based on field evaluations considering field relevance
      and correct detections of data types without mismatches. Two fields marked as
      'MISSING' impacted negatively on the completion score while the overall structure
      and relevance yielded a higher table match score.
