          the current branch.

  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: pull_requests
    target_table_name: pull_request
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.75
    explanation: This table mapping shows a high level of confidence and a reasonably
      complete representation of field mappings. The field-level evaluations indicate
      a close correlation between the source and target schema contexts, with some
      mappings slighty lacking perfect confidence, reflecting a cautious approach
      in cases of ambiguity.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: pull_requests.id
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Exact match on the field designation for a unique identifier.
      - name: issue_id
        expression: pull_requests.issue_url
        score: 0.65
        explanation: Match considered based on URL linking to issue, invoking a slight
          risk of referencing a different context.
      - name: head_repo_id
        expression: pull_requests.head.repo_id
        score: 0.7
        explanation: This mapping is plausible with moderate certainty given the direct
          reference to repository ID under a branch.
      - name: head_user_id
        expression: pull_requests.head.user_id
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Moderately confident matching, taking into account the direct
          relationship to 'user_id' in a specific branch context.
