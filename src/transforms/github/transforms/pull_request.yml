    table_match_score: 0.65
    completion_score: 0.5
    explanation: The table match score reflects a moderate confidence that the source
      and target tables describe similar subject matter, despite some missing field
      mappings. The completion score is reduced due to incomplete data serialization
      between the source and target.
