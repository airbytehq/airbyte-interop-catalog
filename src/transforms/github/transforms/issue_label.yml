    explanation: The table and fields show some alignment, but not entirely complete
      or perfectly matched due to one MISSING expression.

      - name: issue_id
        expression: issue_labels.id
        score: 0.8
        explanation: Properly mapped to a corresponding field in the target schema,
          likely referring to the same entity. Relatively high confidence in match,
          but some ambiguity remains.
