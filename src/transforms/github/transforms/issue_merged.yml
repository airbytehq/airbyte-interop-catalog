  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: pull_requests
    target_table_name: issue_merged
    table_match_score: 0.9
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: The mappings largely align well with the target schema. Most fields
      have clear equivalents but a few are left unmatched or imprecisely matched,
      leading to a slightly lower completion score.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: issue_id
        expression: pull_requests.id
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Field maps directly to a corresponding field in the target schema,
          indicating a strong match and relational integrity.
      - name: merged_at
        expression: pull_requests.merged_at
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Timestamp fields align perfectly in both format and context,
          providing very high confidence in their mapping.
