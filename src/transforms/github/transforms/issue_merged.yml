    explanation: The mapping evaluation produced mixed results. The 'merged_at' field
      has a good matching expression, suggesting a reasonable level of confidence
      in its similarity to the target schema. However, the 'issue_id' field is marked
      as 'MISSING', indicating no good match was found, significantly reducing the
      overall confidence and completion scores.
