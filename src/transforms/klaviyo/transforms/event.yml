  evaluation:

    target_table_name: event
    table_match_score: 0.75
    completion_score: 0.35
    explanation: Partial matches for field mappings with a considerable amount of
      missing matches suggest a moderate table match but low completion. Fields that
      have direct mappings show a high confidence, while several missing mappings
      drastically lower the completion score.
