  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: flows
    target_table_name: flow
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.78
    explanation: Most field mappings have been accurately paired with high confidence
      scores. The table match score indicates a strong correlation between the source
      and target schemas, reflecting a well-aligned table mapping configuration. The
      completion score signifies a high but not full population of the field mappings,
      aligning well with the project criteria which is acceptable given the scenarios
      where some source fields might not be serialized as fully as the target.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: created
        expression: flows.attributes.created
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Strong match for the timestamp field indicating the creation
          time matching perfectly.
      - name: id
        expression: flows.id
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Perfect match with unique ID fields in both source and target.
      - name: name
        expression: flows.attributes.name
        score: 0.88
        explanation: Field name matches directly, indicating a strong representation
          of the same attribute.
      - name: status
        expression: flows.attributes.status
        score: 0.83
        explanation: Good match between status descriptions, slightly less confident
          due to textual variations in descriptions.
      - name: updated
        expression: flows.attributes.updated
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Strong match for the timestamp field indicating the update time
          matching perfectly.
      - name: archived
        expression: flows.attributes.archived
        score: 0.8
        explanation: Good match, boolean fields align well but minor uncertainties
          exist.
      - name: trigger_type
        expression: flows.attributes.trigger_type
        score: 0.85
        explanation: Strong correlation between trigger types hinted by descriptions.
      - name: _fivetran_deleted
        expression: MISSING
        score: 0.0
        explanation: No good match found.
