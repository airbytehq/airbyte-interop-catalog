  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: metrics
    target_table_name: metric
    table_match_score: 0.75
    completion_score: 0.86
    explanation: The table match score indicates a high confidence that the source
      and target tables describe the same domain. The completion score is decent but
      not perfect due to `MISSING` mappings for some fields, decreasing the overall
      confidence.
