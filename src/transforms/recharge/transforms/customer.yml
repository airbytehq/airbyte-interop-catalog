  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: customers
    target_table_name: customer
    table_match_score: 0.9

    explanation: The table mapping demonstrates a high quality of alignment between
      the source and target schemas, indicating they are likely from similar data
      streams. The completion score is slightly lower due to some fields like '_fivetran_deleted'
      not having a proper mapping, indicating that not all fields from the source
      are currently being utilized or mapped in the target schema.
