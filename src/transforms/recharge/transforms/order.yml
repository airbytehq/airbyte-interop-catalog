  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: orders
    target_table_name: order
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.85
    explanation: Most field mappings have a strong alignment with the target schema,
      indicating a high likelihood that the source and target tables describe the
      same subject matter. However, some fields like 'is_deleted' lack a corresponding
      target field, slightly reducing the completion score.
