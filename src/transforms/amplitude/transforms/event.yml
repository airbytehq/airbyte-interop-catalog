          event properties. The nature of these properties depends on both the type
          of product you have, and the specific information you're most interested
          in discovering. For instance, if Swipe is an event you're tracking, the
          event property Direction could have the values Left or Right. Some example
          event properties are description, category, type, duration, level, percent

          2015-08-10T12:00:00.000000 We use this timestamp to organize events on Amplitude
          charts. Note: If the difference between server_received_time and client_upload_time
