  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: email_events
    target_table_name: email_event_bounce
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.9
    explanation: The table mapping between 'email_events' source and target schema
      is fairly strong, reflecting the sharing of most fields relevant to the domain.
      There is a high confidence in the overall schema alignment, but some fields
      might not map completely, hence the slightly less than perfect completion score.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: email_events._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Perfect match as '_fivetran_synced' is standard for all tables
          mapping to source stream's '_airbyte_extracted_at'.
      - name: category
        expression: email_events.category
        score: 0.7
        explanation: The descriptions indicate a good semantic match, suggesting both
          fields relate to email event categorization.
      - name: id
        expression: email_events.id
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct match on 'id' field in both schemas.
      - name: response
        expression: email_events.response
        score: 0.7
        explanation: While different terminologies are used, the fields both refer
          to email server responses, justifying a fairly confident mapping.
      - name: status
        expression: email_events.status
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Mapping is based on a reasonable guess that both fields address
          the status of emails, hence a solid confidence score but not perfect due
          to potential variations in how statuses are represented.
