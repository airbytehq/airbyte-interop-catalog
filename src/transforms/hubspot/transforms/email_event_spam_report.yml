    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: email_events._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Standard mapping for synchronization timestamps, perfectly matched
          between schemas.
      - name: id
        expression: email_events.id
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Direct mapping of identification fields; both pertain to identical
          entities in their respective schema contexts.
      - name: ip_address
        expression: email_events.ipAddress
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Field names suggest the same data, but context is necessary to
          confirm they are indeed the same across different schemas.
      - name: user_agent
        expression: email_events.userAgent
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Given the names and similar usages in tracking user environments,
          it's likely they refer to the same data despite minor naming differences.
