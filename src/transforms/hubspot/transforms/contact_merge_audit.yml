    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.88
    explanation: Given the described mappings, there is a high degree of confidence
      that the source and target tables represent the same data, especially in terms
      of core entity information. The mappings were standardized, with evidence of
      completeness in critical identity and event fields. The source and target fields
      are aligned, indicating that they cover similar subject matters effectively.

      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: contacts_merged_audit._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Standard mapping for all tables with perfect match.
      - name: canonical_vid
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.canonical_vid
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct mapping of core identity fields with identical names.
      - name: contact_id
        expression: MISSING
        score: 0.0
        explanation: No good match found.
      - name: entity_id
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.entity_id
        score: 0.8
        explanation: Direct mapping with no casing penalties.
      - name: first_name
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.first_name
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct mapping of individual identity fields.
      - name: last_name
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.last_name
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct mapping of individual identity fields.

      - name: timestamp
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.timestamp
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Timestamp fields directly mapped, ensuring temporal consistency.
      - name: user_id
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.user_id
        score: 0.6
        explanation: Acceptable match but the potential difference in semantics (e.g.,
          user vs customer).
      - name: vid_to_merge
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.vid_to_merge
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Fuzzy match to existing entity ID fields, close but slightly
          ambiguous in relation context.
