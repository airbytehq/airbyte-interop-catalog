    target_table_name: contact_form_submission
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.75
    explanation: The mapping has a high table match score due to consistent definitions
      and connection between the Fivetran and Airbyte schemas, both sourced from similar
      APIs. The completion score is slightly lower because not all fields could be
      confidently mapped.
