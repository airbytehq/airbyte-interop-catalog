  evaluation:

    target_table_name: deal_pipeline_stage
    table_match_score: 0.7
    completion_score: 0.5
    explanation: The overall table matching score is moderately high, indicating a
      general alignment between source and target schemas, but the completion score
      reveals that not all fields are mapped, indicating gaps in data transformation.
      Some of the key fields like 'probability', 'stage_id', and '_fivetran_deleted'
      remain unmapped as 'MISSING', significantly lowering the overall confidence
      in the data mapping completeness.
