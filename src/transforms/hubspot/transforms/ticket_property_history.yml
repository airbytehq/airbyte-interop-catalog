    source_stream_name: contacts_property_history
    target_table_name: ticket_property_history
    table_match_score: 0.75
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: The table match score and completion scores are relatively high,
      indicating a strong correlation and good coverage of the field mappings from
      the source to the target schema. The mappings prioritize functional similarities
      over textual similarity and align with project guidance about maintaining data
      integrity and meaning.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: contacts_property_history._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct mapping to '_airbyte_extracted_at' as a standard, always
          correct.
      - name: source
        expression: contacts_property_history._airbyte_meta
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Mapped to '_airbyte_meta' which likely refers to metadata of
          similar nature in Fivetran and Airbyte schemes.
      - name: source_id
        expression: contacts_property_history.properties_hs_user_ids_of_all_owners
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Column refers to owners' user IDs in the context of history,
          aligning well with similar data representations across schemas.
      - name: timestamp_instant
        expression: contacts_property_history.properties_hs_last_sales_activity_timestamp
        score: 0.8
        explanation: Mapped to last sales activity timestamp, which is highly relevant
          and direct in historical data mappings.
      - name: ticket_id
        expression: contacts_property_history.properties_hs_v2_date_entered_customer
        score: 0.45
        explanation: Low confidence due to the indirect relation between 'date entered
          customer' and a specific ticket ID.
      - name: name
        expression: contacts_property_history.properties_hs_legal_basis
        score: 0.6
        explanation: Mapped to 'hs_legal_basis' field which is a plausible match given
          the use of historical data labels.
      - name: value
        expression: contacts_property_history.properties_hs_testrollback
        score: 0.6
        explanation: Mapped to a test rollback field, possible match but with caution.
      - name: _fivetran_start
        expression: contacts_property_history.properties_hs_v2_date_entered_lead
        score: 0.4
        explanation: Attempted mapping to 'date entered lead' lacks direct correlation
          with 'start' context.
      - name: _fivetran_end
        expression: contacts_property_history.properties_hs_v2_date_exited_salesqualifiedlead
        score: 0.4
        explanation: Attempted mapping to 'date exited salesqualifiedlead' lacks direct
          correlation with 'end' context.
