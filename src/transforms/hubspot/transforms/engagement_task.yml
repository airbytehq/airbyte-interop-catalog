  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: engagements_tasks
    target_table_name: engagement_task
    table_match_score: 0.9
    completion_score: 0.85
    explanation: The table mapping between the source table 'engagements_tasks' and
      the target schema captures most of the key fields, though it omits some optional
      fields. The fields provided are mapped with high confidence, particularly the
      identifications of date fields and ownership. The confidence in the table matching
      is very high due to the correct and similar fields that are highly relevant
      to both implementations.

      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: engagements_tasks._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: This mapping of '_fivetran_synced' to 'engagements_tasks._airbyte_extracted_at'
          is a standard mapping across all tables, hence the perfect score.
      - name: engagement_id
        expression: engagements_tasks.id

        explanation: Direct mapping of 'engagement_id' aligns with the target schema
          identifier without any discrepancies.
      - name: property_hs_createdate
        expression: engagements_tasks.properties_hs_createdate
        score: 0.8
        explanation: The field matches based on the description and relevance to creation
          date contexts across both schema versions, though minor differences in the
          API version are noted.
      - name: timestamp
        expression: engagements_tasks.properties_hs_timestamp
        score: 0.8
