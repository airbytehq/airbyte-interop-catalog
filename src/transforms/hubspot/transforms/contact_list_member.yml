    target_table_name: contact_list_member
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.6
    explanation: The table match score is relatively high due to the likelihood that
      the source and target tables are describing the same subject matter based on
      API descriptions. The completion score is moderate as not all possible fields
      are fully mapped or have high confidence mappings.
