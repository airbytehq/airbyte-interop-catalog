  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: email_events
    target_table_name: email_event_click
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.75
    explanation: The table mapping has a high confidence score for matching the source
      and target tables, reflecting the good correlation in the context of shared
      upstream source APIs from Airbyte and Fivetran. The completion score indicates
      a substantial but not full serialization of fields, relevant to the careful
      mapping of each field while considering differences in terms like singular vs
      plural and casing.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: email_events._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: This is a standard mapping, always matching Airbyte's '_airbyte_extracted_at'
          column to Fivetran's '_fivetran_synced' field. Score is thus perfect.
      - name: browser
        expression: email_events.browser
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Direct mapping of 'email_events.browser' which correctly reflects
          the field's meaning and format without deviation.
      - name: id
        expression: email_events.id
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Relevant direct column mapping from 'email_events.id' with clear
          identity preservation.
      - name: ip_address
        expression: email_events.ipAddress
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Field 'email_events.ipAddress' closely matches target field 'ip_address',
          noting the slight format difference in casing but maintaining the correct
          meaning.
      - name: location
        expression: email_events.location
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Direct and appropriate mapping of 'email_events.location', target
          mirroring source adequately.
      - name: referer
        expression: email_events.referer
        score: 0.85
        explanation: The field maps correctly from 'email_events.referer' to 'referer'
          with contextual matching about links from web sources.
      - name: url
        expression: email_events.url
        score: 0.6
        explanation: Mapping of 'email_events.url' has slightly lower confidence due
          to potential variations in URL patterns or usage but remains a justified
          match.
      - name: user_agent
        expression: email_events.userAgent
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Field 'email_events.userAgent' is well translated to 'user_agent',
