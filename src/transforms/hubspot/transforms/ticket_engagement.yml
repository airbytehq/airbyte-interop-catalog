  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: engagements
    target_table_name: ticket_engagement
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.75
    explanation: The table match score is relatively high because both source and
      target tables are being generated from a similar API context, indicating a strong
      alignment in the data's subject matter. The completion score is lower due to
      some missing field mappings which could not be confidently matched, reflecting
      a partial but significant overlap in fields between source and target schemas.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: engagements._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct mapping to source streams '_airbyte_extracted_at' always
          scores a 1.00 as it is considered a standard requirement for all tables.
      - name: ticket_id
        expression: engagements.associations_ticketIds
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Mapped to 'engagements.associations_ticketIds' with reasonably
          high confidence, as it closely represents the 'ticket_id' in a typical schema,
          but less than perfect due to potential variations in ticket ID context across
          applications.
      - name: engagement_id
        expression: engagements.id
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Mapped to 'engagements.id' with high confidence due to direct
          relevance and similarity in concept, though the lack of more detailed context
          hinders a perfect score.
