  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: transactions
    target_table_name: transaction_subscription
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: Both mappings point towards a transaction-related context, implying
      a reasonably high likelihood that they refer to the same data context. Although
      the expressions involve IDs linked with transactions and subscriptions, which
      are usually tightly connected, the specific distinction ensures a less than
      perfect score.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: transaction_id
        expression: transactions.id
        score: 0.9
        explanation: The expression 'transactions.id' indicates a direct and meaningful
          mapping for 'transaction_id'.
      - name: subscription_id
        expression: transactions.subscription_ids
        score: 0.6
        explanation: While 'transactions.subscription_ids' signifies a potential match
          for 'subscription_id', the pluralization in 'subscription_ids' might suggest
          an array or multiple entries, presenting some uncertainty.
