  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: subscriptions
    target_table_name: subscription_history
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.6
    explanation: The table mapping demonstrates a high level of confidence due to
      clear connections between commonly named attributes such as 'id', 'created_at',
      and 'updated_at', which are reliable indicators of a subscription-related table.
      However, there are several key fields missing, impacting the overall completion
      score. The fields that have direct matches exhibit well-mapped relations, suggesting
      that the source and target schemas are describing similar subscription-related
      information but the completeness of the field mapping is not fully achieved.
