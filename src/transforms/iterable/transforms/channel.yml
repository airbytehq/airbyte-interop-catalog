    explanation: Based on the detailed matching criteria provided, there is a relative
      high confidence that the source and target tables are about the same subject
      matter, and most expected fields are aligned. Some discrepancies in completeness
      reduce the total score.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: channels.id
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Direct match on field 'id' with proper correspondence in schema.
      - name: name
        expression: channels.name
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Field 'name' matches well, and case insensitivity does not affect
          the score.
      - name: channel_type
        expression: channels.channelType
        score: 0.85
        explanation: Field 'channel_type' has a good semantic match even though the
          terms are not identical.
      - name: message_medium
        expression: channels.messageMedium
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Field 'message_medium' matches, but the correspondence is less
          obvious, hence a lower score.
