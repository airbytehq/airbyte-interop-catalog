    source_stream_name: email_unsubscribe
    target_table_name: user_unsubscribed_channel_history
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: The table mapping score is high given that the source and target
      schema both derive from similar APIs ensuring a good field mapping alignment.
      Except for '_airbyte_extracted_at' aliasing to '_fivetran_synced', the other
      fields matched relatively closely.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: channel_id
        expression: email_unsubscribe.channelId
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Fuzzy match to 'channelId' is reasonable, as both refer to identifiers
          of a channel in slightly different notations.
      - name: email
        expression: email_unsubscribe.email
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Direct mapping to 'email' is accurate and common across different
          schemas since this is a standard field identifying unique users.
      - name: updated_at
        expression: email_unsubscribe._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: "'_airbyte_extracted_at' directly maps to '_fivetran_synced'
          ensuring a perfect sync of timestamp data across systems."
