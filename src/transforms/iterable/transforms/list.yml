  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: lists
    target_table_name: list
    table_match_score: 0.9
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: The table match score is high at 0.9, indicating a strong likelihood
      that the source and target tables are describing the same content. The completion
      score is 0.8, reflecting that most but not all field mappings are confidently
      populated.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: lists.id
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct match found with exact name and context matching between
          lists.id and target id field, no casing difference.
      - name: name
        expression: lists.name
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Exact name match and explicit context alignment between lists.name
          and target name field.
      - name: list_type
        expression: lists.listType
        score: 0.9
        explanation: High confidence due to semantic closeness of 'listType' to 'list_type'.
      - name: created_at
        expression: lists.createdAt
        score: 0.9
        explanation: Field name casing difference is not penalized, and context supports
          high match confidence between 'createdAt' and 'created_at'.
