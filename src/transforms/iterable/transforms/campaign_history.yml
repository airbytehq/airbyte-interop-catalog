  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: campaigns
    target_table_name: campaign_history
    table_match_score: 0.9
    completion_score: 0.85
    explanation: The table mapping between source campaigns and target campaigns is
      highly aligned, indicating a strong correlation in the subject matter across
      both datasets. Fields such as 'id', 'name', and 'updated_at' have direct equivalents,
      contributing to a high table match score. The completion score is slightly lower
      due to missing mappings for certain specific fields that could not be accurately
      matched or were not present in the source.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: campaigns.id
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Direct mapping with identical field names and purposes.
      - name: updated_at
        expression: campaigns.updatedAt
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Direct mapping with only slight differences in notation (underscore
          vs camelCase).
      - name: name
        expression: campaigns.name
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Perfect match between field names and purposes.
      - name: campaign_state
        expression: campaigns.campaignState
        score: 0.8
        explanation: Good match considering likely synonyms in different schema implementations.
      - name: type
        expression: campaigns.type
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Reasonable match, although 'type' can be general, the context
          makes it sufficiently specific.
      - name: send_size
        expression: campaigns.sendSize
        score: 0.85
        explanation: Strong match based on field purpose and context.
      - name: start_at
        expression: campaigns.startAt
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Very close match, minor notation differences.
      - name: ended_at
        expression: campaigns.endedAt
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Very close match, minor notation differences.
      - name: created_at
        expression: campaigns.createdAt
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Very close match, minor notation differences.
      - name: recurring_campaign_id
        expression: campaigns.recurringCampaignId
        score: 0.65
        explanation: A specific match that slightly depends on the overall schema
          understanding.
      - name: created_by_user_id
        expression: campaigns.createdByUserId
        score: 0.6
        explanation: Adequate mapping, close relevance but slightly ambiguous without
          additional context.
      - name: template_id
        expression: campaigns.templateId
        score: 0.65
        explanation: Reasonable confidence, assuming 'template' refers commonly to
          a structural element in campaigns.
      - name: updated_by_user_id
        expression: campaigns.updatedByUserId
        score: 0.6
        explanation: Adequate mapping, close relevance could vary based on schema
          definitions.
      - name: message_medium
        expression: campaigns.messageMedium
        score: 0.5
        explanation: Borderline acceptable, given the generic nature of 'medium' and
          specific use in campaign context.
