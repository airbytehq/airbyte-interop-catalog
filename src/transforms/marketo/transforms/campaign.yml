  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: campaigns
    target_table_name: campaign
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.4
    explanation: Overall, the table match quality is high, suggesting a strong correlation
      between the source and target tables. However, the completion score is relatively
      low, indicating that many fields from the source are not successfully mapped
      to the target, reducing the overall confidence in the mapping completeness.
