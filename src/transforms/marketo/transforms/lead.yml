  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: leads
    target_table_name: lead
    table_match_score: 0.75
    completion_score: 0.92
    explanation: The table match score reflects a relatively high confidence in matching
      the core structures of the lead records between the source and target system,
      as indicated by the largely consistent mapping expressions. The completion score
      is slightly reduced due to several fields set as 'MISSING' indicating that not
      all target fields could be populated from the source data.
