  evaluation:

    table_match_score: 0.95
    completion_score: 0.62
    explanation: The majority of fields have a direct mapping, indicating a strong
      match between the source and target schema for the 'Programs' table. Several
      crucial fields like 'id', 'name', and 'description' are well-matched. However,
      the presence of several 'MISSING' field mappings, such as 'end_date', 'sfdc_id',
      'sfdc_name', and 'start_date' lowers the completion score as these are important
      for complete data transformation but couldn't be appropriately mapped.
