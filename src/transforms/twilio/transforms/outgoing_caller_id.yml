  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: outgoing_caller_ids
    target_table_name: outgoing_caller_id
    table_match_score: 0.95
    completion_score: 0.9
    explanation: The table mapping is highly reliable with a near-identical structure
      and format between the source and target schemas, which are derived from comparable
      API implementations. Most fields are well-aligned, though not all from the source
      are present in the target, explaining the slightly less than perfect completion
      score.
