  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: campaigns
    target_table_name: campaign_history
    table_match_score: 0.9
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: The table matching has a high confidence as both source and target
      implementations seem to describe similar campaigns data, with slight variations
      in field serialization. Most fields are well-aligned with clear matching expressions,
      contributing to a high table match score. The completion score is slightly lower
      due to a few fields with no exact matches but are generally paired within acceptable
      thresholds.
