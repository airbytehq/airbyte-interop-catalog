    target_table_name: basic_ad_actions
    table_match_score: 0.7
    completion_score: 0.4
    explanation: Given the high number of MISSING expressions indicating no good matches
      found for many of the fields, both table match and completion scores are impacted
      negatively. The presence of one correctly matched field (_fivetran_synced) does
      contribute positively, but overall the integration of these fields into the
      target schema is suboptimal.
