    table_match_score: 0.5
    completion_score: 0.75
    explanation:
      The table match score is 0.5 due to partial similarity between the
      source and target schemas. The completion score is 0.75 as most fields are mapped,
      but some are missing or poorly matched.

      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: metafield_orders._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation:
          Standard mapping of '_fivetran_synced' to '_airbyte_extracted_at',
          always scores 1.0.
      - name: key
        expression: metafield_orders.key
        score: 0.7
        explanation:
          Fields 'key' in source and 'key' in target are likely referring
          to the same entity, mapped with a score of 0.7.
      - name: order_id
        expression: MISSING
        score: 0.0
        explanation: Expression is 'MISSING', no good match found.
      - name: value
        expression: metafield_orders.value
        score: 0.6
        explanation:
          Fields 'value' in source and 'value' in target mapped with a
          lower confidence due to minimal contextual match.
