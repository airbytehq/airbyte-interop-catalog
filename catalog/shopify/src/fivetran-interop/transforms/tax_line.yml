    completion_score: 0.5714285714285714
    explanation:
      The table mapping quality is relatively high, given that most field
      names have corresponding expressions from similar schemas. However, several
      fields are marked as 'MISSING,' indicating incomplete field mappings and reducing
      the completion score. The standard mapping of '_fivetran_synced' to '_airbyte_extracted_at'
      boosts confidence significantly. The lack of a logical or exact match for 'index',
      'order_line_id', and 'rate' fields decreases the completion score as they are
      marked 'MISSING'.
