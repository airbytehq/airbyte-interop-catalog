  evaluation:

    target_table_name: order_tag
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.5
    explanation:
      The table match score is relatively high because the `_fivetran_synced`
      was successfully mapped to `_airbyte_extracted_at`, a standard mapping. However,
      two of the field mappings have expressions set to 'MISSING', resulting in a
      lower completion score.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: orders._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation:
          _fivetran_synced is always mapped to _airbyte_extracted_at with
          a perfect score of 1.00 as it is a standard mapping.
