  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: collects
    target_table_name: collection_product
    table_match_score: 0.7
    completion_score: 0.8
    explanation: The table mapping was evaluated with a high table match score as
      the subject matter aligns closely between source and target, hence a match score
      of 0.70. The completion score is 0.80, indicating some fields have good mapping
      and coverage from source to target with a slight room for improvement.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: collects._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Standard mapping to the source stream's _airbyte_extracted_at
          column.
      - name: collection_id
        expression: collects.collection_id
        score: 0.7
        explanation: ID referencing the `collection` has a relevant mapping. Given
          score reflects strong, but not perfect match due to potential contextual
          differences.
      - name: product_id
        expression: collects.product_id
        score: 0.7
        explanation: ID referencing the `product` aligns closely in purpose but may
          differ slightly in context in some implementations, hence the score.
