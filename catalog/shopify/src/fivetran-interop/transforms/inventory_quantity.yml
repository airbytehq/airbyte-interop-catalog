  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: inventory_levels
    target_table_name: inventory_quantity
    table_match_score: 0.65
    completion_score: 0.86
    explanation: The table match score reflects a fairly good match between the source
      and target table schemas, as they share related fields and concepts. However,
      it's not perfect due to field variations and expressions not directly matching
      for all fields. The completion score is high as most fields have corresponding
      expressions in the source schema, with '_fivetran_synced' correctly mapped to
      '_airbyte_extracted_at'.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: inventory_levels.id
        score: 0.85
        explanation: The field 'id' from the target is matched with 'inventory_levels.id'
          from the source, which has a fairly high confidence as they both represent
          unique identifiers.
      - name: inventory_item_id
        expression: inventory_levels.inventory_item_id
        score: 0.8
        explanation: The field 'inventory_item_id' is matched with 'inventory_levels.inventory_item_id',
          which likely represents the same concept.
      - name: inventory_level_id
        expression: inventory_levels.location_id
        score: 0.75
        explanation: The field 'inventory_level_id' is matched with 'inventory_levels.location_id'.
          Although they seem to relate to location, the exact match is less clear,
          warranting caution.
      - name: name
        expression: inventory_levels.locations_count
        score: 0.5
        explanation: The field 'name' is mapped to 'inventory_levels.locations_count'.
          This is a weaker match since 'name' typically denotes a text descriptor
          rather than a count.
      - name: quantity
        expression: inventory_levels.available
        score: 0.9
        explanation: The field 'quantity' is well matched with 'inventory_levels.available',
          both referring to the available quantity of an inventory item.
      - name: updated_at
        expression: inventory_levels.updated_at
        score: 0.95
        explanation: The field 'updated_at' is confidently mapped to 'inventory_levels.updated_at',
          reflecting the same timestamp for updates.
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: inventory_levels._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Standard mapping with 100% confidence as '_fivetran_synced' always
          maps to '_airbyte_extracted_at'.
