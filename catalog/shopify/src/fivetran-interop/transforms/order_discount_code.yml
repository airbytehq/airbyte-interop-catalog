  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: discount_codes
    target_table_name: order_discount_code
    table_match_score: 0.8
    completion_score: 0.6
    explanation: The table mapping is of moderate quality with certain fields perfectly
      mapped, some fields with potential mappings, and others missing entirely. A
      score of 0.8 reflects that the table structure is very likely describing the
      same subject matter, but not entirely complete due to missing field mappings.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: discount_codes._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: 'Standard mapping: `_fivetran_synced` to `_airbyte_extracted_at`,
          always scores 1.00.'
      - name: amount
        expression: discount_codes.total_sales.amount
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Mapping `amount` to `discount_codes.total_sales.amount` is potentially
          correct given context, but exact match not certain.
      - name: code
        expression: discount_codes.code
        score: 0.7
        explanation: Mapping `code` to `discount_codes.code` is likely correct based
          on contextual description of discount application.

          given context of discount type enumeration.
