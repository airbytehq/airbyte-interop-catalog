    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.9
    explanation:
      The table match between the source and target schema is strong due
      to shared API origins and significant overlap in field mapping. However, a few
      fields are missing or uncertain mappings, slightly reducing the overall completion
      score.
