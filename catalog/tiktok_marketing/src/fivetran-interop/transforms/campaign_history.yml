    explanation:
      The overall mapping confidence score is high due to close matches
      between field names and their expressions. However, 'status' field has an expression
      of 'MISSING', reducing the score. One column, _fivetran_synced, is recommended
      to map to _airbyte_extracted_at but is not present in the mappings list.
