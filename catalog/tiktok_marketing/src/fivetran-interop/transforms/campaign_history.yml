  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: campaigns
    target_table_name: campaign_history
    name_match_score: 0.7
    score: 0.69
    explanation:
      The overall confidence score was calculated by evaluating individual
      mappings. Most mappings matched perfectly with applicable expressions like 'campaigns.campaign_id'
      for 'campaign_id'. However, fields like 'opt_status' and 'status' were marked
      'MISSING', resulting in a score of 0.0 for these fields and affecting the overall
      score. The mapping '_airbyte_extracted_at' was appropriately aligned with 'updated_at'
      though '_fivetran_synced' was not present. If expressions are missing or non-applicable,
      they heavily impact the overall confidence below the score threshold of 0.7.
