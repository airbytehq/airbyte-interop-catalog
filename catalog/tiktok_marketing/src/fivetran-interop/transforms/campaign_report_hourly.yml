    table_match_score: 0.95
    completion_score: 0.97
    explanation:
      The table and field mappings are highly accurate. The mapping configuration
      includes a variety of field mappings that closely align with their expressions,
      with few MISSING mappings indicating minor gaps in completion. Generally, mappings
      such as '_fivetran_synced' to '_airbyte_extracted_at' are perfectly matched,
      resulting in a high table match score. Other fields are accurately associated
      with the correct expressions, suggesting they describe the same subject matter
      from a shared source. This results in a high completion score due to the absence
      of non-mappable fields, apart from minor misses like 'total_sales_lead_value'
      and 'profile_visits_rate'.
