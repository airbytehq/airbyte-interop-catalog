### Mapping: Airbyte `campaigns_reports_hourly` to Fivetran `campaign_report_hourly`


- Table Match Confidence Score: 🟢 _0.95__
- Table Completion Score: 🟢 _0.97_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _The table and field mappings are highly accurate. The mapping configuration includes a variety of field mappings that closely align with their expressions, with few MISSING mappings indicating minor gaps in completion.
