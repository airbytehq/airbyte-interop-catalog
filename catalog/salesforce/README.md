# Mapping Guide: Airbyte-to-Fivetran

The below guide will help you map Airbyte schemas to corresponding Fivetran schemas. Guidance is AI-generated and includes confidence scores (with explanation) for each table and field mapping.

## Companion Project for `dbt` Users

Please see the companion [airbyte-interop-dbt-project](./airbyte-interop-dbt-project) directory, which contains a `dbt` project with ready-to-use SQL models for each of the below mappings.

## Table-Level Mappings

### How to Use these Mappings

The below guides, and the companion dbt project, will help you shape your new Airbyte datasets to more closely match your legacy Fivetran dataset schemas.

This can be helpful if:

1. You have existing code that relies on Fivetran-shaped datasets.
2. You have one or more dependencies on Fivetran-managed dbt packages.
3. You have custom code that needs to be updated to leverage Airbyte data schemas, where you previously ingested Fivetran-shaped datasets.

In any of these cases, you can use the below mapping logic to shape your new data to fit old data schema requirements and **save time** in your migration.
