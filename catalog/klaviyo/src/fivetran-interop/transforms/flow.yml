  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: flows
    target_table_name: flow
    table_match_score: 0.75
    completion_score: 1.0
    explanation: The table matching score reflects a strong correlation between the
      source and target schemas, as they both derive from a similar API. The completion
      score is perfect as all required field mappings are present, with the standard
      sync field mapping receiving a high confidence score.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: flows.id
        score: 0.95
        explanation: Mapping is straightforward as 'id' aligns well with the typical
          unique identifier.
      - name: name
        expression: flows.attributes.name
        score: 0.95
        explanation: The 'name' mapping aligns well, representing the flow's name
          accurately.
      - name: created
        expression: flows.attributes.created
        score: 0.9
        explanation: The 'created' mapping accurately captures the timestamp for when
          the flow was created.
      - name: updated
        expression: flows.attributes.updated
        score: 0.9
        explanation: The 'updated' mapping accurately reflects the last updated timestamp
          for the flow.
      - name: status
        expression: flows.attributes.status
        score: 0.8
        explanation: The 'status' mapping is acceptable, representing the current
          status of the flow.
      - name: trigger_type
        expression: flows.attributes.trigger_type
        score: 0.8
        explanation: The 'trigger_type' mapping aligns well as it captures the initiation
          type for the flow.
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: flows._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: Standard sync mapping from '_fivetran_synced' to '_airbyte_extracted_at',
          always scoring maximally.
