### Mapping: Airbyte `campaigns` to Fivetran `campaign`


- Table Match Confidence Score: 游릭 _0.85_
- Table Completion Score: 游릭 _0.75_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _The table match score suggests that the source and target tables describe the same subject matter with reasonable confidence. However, not all fields could be confidently mapped, resulting in a lower completion score._

| Field | Description | Expression | Confidence | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `_fivetran_deleted` | Boolean that is true if the campaign has been soft-deleted. | `campaigns.attributes.archived` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *The expression 'campaigns.attributes.archived' seems to indicate whether a campaign is deleted, similar to '_fivetran_deleted'.* |
| `campaign_type` | Type of campaign. | `campaigns.attributes.channel` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *The expression 'campaigns.attributes.channel' likely maps well to 'campaign_type', denoting the type of campaign.* |
| `created` | Timestamp of when the campaign was created, in UTC. | `campaigns.attributes.created_at` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *The expression 'campaigns.attributes.created_at' appears to indicate the creation timestamp, mapping well to 'created'.* |
| `email_template_id` | Foreign key referencing the ID of the email_template object that will be the content of this campaign. | `campaigns.attributes.template_id` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *Given it's a foreign key, 'campaigns.attributes.template_id' likely maps to 'email_template_id'.* |
| `from_email` | The email address your email will be sent from and will be used in the reply-to header. | `campaigns.attributes.from_email` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *The email expressions map well together, as 'campaigns.attributes.from_email' indicates the sender email.* |
| `from_name` | The name or label associated with the email address you're sending from. | `campaigns.attributes.from_name` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *The expression 'campaigns.attributes.from_name' maps well to identify the sender name.* |
| `id` | Unique ID of the campaign. | `campaigns.id` | 游릭 _1.00_ | *Exact match as 'campaigns.id' clearly maps to 'id'.* |
| `name` | A name for this campaign. If not specified, this will default to the subject of the campaign. | `campaigns.attributes.name` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *'campaigns.attributes.name' captures the essence of 'name' for a campaign.* |
| `send_time` | Timestamp of when the campaign is scheduled to be sent in the future. | `campaigns.attributes.send_time` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *The mapping to 'campaigns.attributes.send_time' indicates scheduling information.* |
| `sent_at` | Timestamp of when the campaign was first sent out to users. | `campaigns.attributes.sent_at` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *The expression 'campaigns.attributes.sent_at' indicates the time sent, mapping well to 'sent_at'.* |
| `status` | Current status of the campaign. Either "draft", "scheduled", "sent", or "cancelled". | `campaigns.attributes.status` | 游릭 _0.70_ | *'campaigns.attributes.status' for campaign state aligns well with 'status'.* |
| `_fivetran_synced` | Timestamp when this record was last synced. | `campaigns._airbyte_extracted_at` | 游릭 _1.00_ | *Standard mapping of '_fivetran_synced' to '_airbyte_extracted_at' with full confidence.* |

### Mapping: Airbyte `metrics` to Fivetran `metric`


- Table Match Confidence Score: 游릭 _0.85_
- Table Completion Score: 游릭 _0.95_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _The table mapping is highly confident, as most fields align well between the source and target schemas. The completion score is high because almost all fields are matched, including the special handling of '_fivetran_synced'._

| Field | Description | Expression | Confidence | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
