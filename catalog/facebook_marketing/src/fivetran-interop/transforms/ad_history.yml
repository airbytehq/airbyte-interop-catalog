  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: ads
    target_table_name: ad_history
    table_match_score: 0.95
    completion_score: 0.89
    explanation: The table match score is high due to the strong alignment of most
      fields between the source and target schemas, indicating they describe similar
      subjects. The completion score is slightly lower due to the presence of a 'MISSING'
      field mapping, which indicates that not all fields have a direct match.
