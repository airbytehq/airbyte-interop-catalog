  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: ad_sets
    target_table_name: ad_set_history
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.75
    explanation:
      The table mapping evaluation indicates a moderate to high confidence
      in the table subject matching, primarily based on shared semantics derived from
      similar schemas in the source and target tables, both of which are generated
      from equivalent API endpoints. However, there are significant disparities in
      the field mappings, particularly with undefined fields marked as 'MISSING',
      which affects the completion score.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: id
        expression: ad_sets.id
        score: 0.95
        explanation:
          The 'id' field has a clear and direct match between source and
          target.

          both source and target schemas.
      - name: name
        expression: ad_sets.name
        score: 0.95
        explanation:
          The 'name' field matches perfectly, consistent across the source
          and target mappings.
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: ad_sets._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0

          The 'end_time' field mapping is confident, referring to the same
          entity in both schemas.
      - name: bid_strategy
        expression: ad_sets.bid_strategy
        score: 0.95
