### Mapping: Airbyte `ad_creatives` to Fivetran `creative_history`


- Table Match Confidence Score: ‚ö†Ô∏è _0.50_
- Table Completion Score: ‚ùå _0.20_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _Given the numerous 'MISSING' expressions in the field mappings, the table mapping demonstrates an overall low confidence. While the mapping for '_fivetran_synced' is accurate, the lack of valid expressions for other crucial fields significantly lowers the completion score._

### Mapping: Airbyte `ads_insights_action_type` to Fivetran `basic_ad_actions`


- Table Match Confidence Score: üü¢ _0.70_
- Table Completion Score: ‚ùå _0.40_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _Given the high number of MISSING expressions indicating no good matches found for many of the fields, both table match and completion scores are impacted negatively. The presence of one correctly matched field (_fivetran_synced) does contribute positively, but overall the integration of these fields into the target schema is suboptimal._

| Field | Description | Expression | Confidence | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `_1_d_view` | Conversion metric value using an attribution window of "1 day after viewing the ad". Not included in downstream models by default, but can be added using the `facebook_ads__basic_ad_actions_passthrough_metrics` var. | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |

### Mapping: Airbyte `ads_insights_action_conversion_device` to Fivetran `basic_ad_action_values`


- Table Match Confidence Score: üü¢ _0.85_
- Table Completion Score: üü¢ _0.75_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _The table matching quality is high based on the standard table structure from a shared API, but the completion of field mappings is not fully achieved due to multiple 'MISSING' expressions._

| Field | Description | Expression | Confidence | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `_7_d_click` | Conversion metric value using an attribution window of "7 days after clicking the ad". Not included in downstream models by default, but can be added using the `facebook_ads__basic_ad_actions_passthrough_metrics` var. | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |

| `ad_id` | The ID of the ad the report relates to. | `ads_insights_action_conversion_device.ad_id` | üü¢ _0.90_ | *'ad_id' maps directly to its corresponding ID field in the target, ensuring a high confidence.* |
| `date` | The date of the reported performance. | `ads_insights_action_conversion_device.date_start` | üü¢ _1.00_ | *Perfect mapping of 'date' to 'date_start', reflecting identical data.* |
| `index` | Index reflecting the `action_type` tracked for this ad on this day. Column of not much consequence. | `MISSING` | ‚ö†Ô∏è _0.50_ | *Low relevance of the 'index' makes this a lower confidence mapping.* |
| `value` | Monetary value associated with the convesion action using the default attribution window. | `ads_insights_action_conversion_device.converted_product_value` | üü¢ _0.80_ | *The 'value' maps well to 'converted_product_value', albeit with minor potential discrepancies in context.* |

- Table Match Confidence Score: üü¢ _0.90_
- Table Completion Score: üü¢ _0.75_
