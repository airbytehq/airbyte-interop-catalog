  evaluation:
    source_stream_name: contacts_merged_audit
    target_table_name: contact_merge_audit
    table_match_score: 0.85
    completion_score: 0.9
    explanation: The source and target tables are highly likely describing the same
      subject matter since the fields have meaningful mappings. However, there's a
      missing match affecting the completion score slightly.
    field_mapping_evals:
      - name: _fivetran_synced
        expression: contacts_merged_audit._airbyte_extracted_at
        score: 1.0
        explanation: _fivetran_synced is perfectly mapped to _airbyte_extracted_at
          as per standard convention.
      - name: canonical_vid
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.canonical_vid
        score: 0.9
        explanation: The contact ID canonical_vid matches strongly to a similar ID
          field, indicating a high confidence.
      - name: contact_id
        expression: MISSING
        score: 0.0
        explanation: No good match found.
      - name: entity_id
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.entity_id
        score: 0.8
        explanation: entity_id has a reasonable match with fields in the target schema
          that relate to entities.
      - name: first_name
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.first_name
        score: 0.8
        explanation: The first name field aligns well with a similarly purposed field
          in the target schema.
      - name: last_name
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.last_name
        score: 0.8
        explanation: The last name field aligns well with a similarly purposed field
          in the target schema.
      - name: num_properties_moved
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.num_properties_moved
        score: 0.7
        explanation: The field num_properties_moved relates closely to a count of
          properties, suggesting reasonable confidence.
      - name: timestamp
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.timestamp
        score: 0.85
        explanation: The timestamp field is a direct match with a similarly intended
          field in the target.
      - name: user_id
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.user_id
        score: 0.7
        explanation: user_id matches a user-related field sufficiently, though not
          perfectly.
      - name: vid_to_merge
        expression: contacts_merged_audit.vid_to_merge
        score: 0.9
