    name_match_score: 0.25
    score: 0.44
    explanation:
      The overall table mapping confidence score is calculated based on
      individual field mapping scores. Mappings with 'MISSING' expressions are given
      a score of 0.0, which significantly impacts the overall score. High confidence
      mappings such as '_fivetran_synced' contribute positively.
