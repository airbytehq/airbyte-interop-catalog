    explanation: The table and field mappings include several 'MISSING' entries, indicating
      incomplete mapping. However, certain fields like '_fivetran_synced' have confident
      mappings based on standard conventions. Moreover, fields like 'display_order',
      'label', 'created_at', and 'updated_at' have plausible mappings, albeit with
      less confidence due to lack of complete corroboration across source and target
      schemas.
