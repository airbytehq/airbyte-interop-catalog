### Mapping: Airbyte `forms` to Fivetran `form`


- Table Match Confidence Score: üü¢ _0.90_
- Table Completion Score: üü¢ _0.69_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _The table mapping score is high because the tables share many common fields, indicating they likely describe similar subjects. However, the completion score is lower due to several fields mapped as 'MISSING'._
