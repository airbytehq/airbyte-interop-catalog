# Morph Catalog

This is a catalog of source and target schemas. Each connector follows a standard directory structure that facilitates the transformation of Airbyte source schemas into target schemas like Fivetran-compatible formats.

Assets in the catalog are a combination of:

- Airbyte source schema info, obtained from the connector's `schema` folder or via discovery.
- Target schemas, such as those we want to reshape our source data into.
- Generated files, file artifacts generated by our processes.

## Adding a New Connector

Check the [Advanced Usage Guide Docs](../docs/USAGE.md) for information on creating and maintaining a new connector.
