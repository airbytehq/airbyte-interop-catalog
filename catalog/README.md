# Morph Catalog

This is a catalog of source and target schemas.

Assets in the catalog are a combination of:

- Airbyte source schema info, obtained from the connector's `schema` folder or via discovery.
- Target schemas, such as those we want to reshape our source data into.
- Generated files, file artifacts generated by our processes.
