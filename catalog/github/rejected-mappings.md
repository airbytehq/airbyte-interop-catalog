### Mapping: Airbyte `issue_labels` to Fivetran `issue_label`


- Table Match Confidence Score: ‚ùå _0.00_
- Table Completion Score: ‚ùå _0.00_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _Both mappings have set their expression to 'MISSING', indicating a complete lack of confidence. There is no evidence to suggest a reliable match or mapping validity due to the absence of specified expressions._

| Field | Description | Expression | Confidence | Evaluation |

| `label_id` | Unique identifier of the used label | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |

### Mapping: Airbyte `reviews` to Fivetran `requested_reviewer_history`


- Table Match Confidence Score: üü¢ _0.85_
- Table Completion Score: ‚ö†Ô∏è _0.50_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _The table match is highly confident due to the similarity of the source and target schemas originating from similar source APIs, indicating they likely describe the same subject matter. However, the completion score is reduced due to the missing mappings for several fields which could not find a good match._
