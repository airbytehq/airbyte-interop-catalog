### Mapping: Airbyte `MISSING` to Fivetran `repository`


- Table Match Confidence Score: ‚ùå _0.00_
- Table Completion Score: ‚ùå _0.00_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _All field mappings have been set to 'MISSING' indicating there is no confidence in the field mappings. No good matches have been found, thus the table match and completion scores are 0._

| Field | Description | Expression | Confidence | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | System generated unique id for the repository. | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |
| `created_at` | Timestamp of when the repository was created. | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |
| `full_name` | The name of the git repository. | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |

### Mapping: Airbyte `issue_timeline_events` to Fivetran `issue_closed_history`


- Table Match Confidence Score: ‚ö†Ô∏è _0.50_
- Table Completion Score: ‚ùå _0.33_
- Summary Self-Evaluation: _The mappings provided include missing expressions signifying no good match found for some required fields, leading to a lower completion score. The table match score is moderate, indicating a potential match but with uncertainty._

| Field | Description | Expression | Confidence | Evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `issue_id` | Foreign key that references the issue table | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp of when the action took place | `issue_timeline_events.comment.updated_at` | üü¢ _1.00_ | *Direct mapping confirmed, ensuring high confidence.* |
| `closed` | Boolean variable for if the issue was closed (true) or re-opened (false) | `MISSING` | ‚ùå _0.00_ | *No good match found.* |

### Mapping: Airbyte `MISSING` to Fivetran `issue_assignee`


- Table Match Confidence Score: ‚ùå _0.00_
